      <h1>Storyline</h1>
      <p>
        In Disney's beguiling animated romp, rebellious 16-year-old mermaid
        Ariel is fascinated with life on land. On one of her visits to the
        surface, which are forbidden by her controlling father, King Triton, she
        falls for a human prince. Determined to be with her new love, Ariel
        makes a dangerous deal with the sea witch Ursula to become human for
        three days. But when plans go awry for the star-crossed lovers, the king
        must make the ultimate sacrifice for his daughter.
